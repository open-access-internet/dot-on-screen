# Moving Point Program

This program creates a point on the screen that continuously moves, demonstrating basic animation and motion. It's a simple example for anyone looking to explore graphical interfaces and basic animation in C++.

## Features
- Displays a point that moves continuously across the screen.
- Simple graphical animation to demonstrate movement.
- A lightweight executable (.exe) that works out of the box on Windows.

## Requirements
- Windows operating system (since itâ€™s packaged as an `.exe` file).
- No need for additional dependencies if you use the `.msi` installer.

## Installation

### Option 1: Using the .MSI Installer
1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/open-access-internet/dot-on-screen/releases) of this repository.
2. Download the latest **`.msi`** installer.
3. Run the `.msi` installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
4. Once installed, you can launch the program directly from the Start Menu or from a desktop shortcut.

### Option 2: Manual Installation (For Developers)
If you want to compile the program yourself or modify the source code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/open-access-internet/dot-on-screen.git 
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build the project to generate the `.exe` file.
4. Once built, run the compiled `.exe` to see the moving point animation.

## Usage

After installing via the `.msi` installer, you can launch the program from the Start Menu or your desktop. The program will display a point that moves continuously across the screen.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the source code to adjust the speed, size, or direction of the point. You can also experiment with more advanced animation techniques.
